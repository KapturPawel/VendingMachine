VendingMachine

Project done in June 2016 with friend. That was my first Java project using design patterns.

First is State pattern. Is used in Vending Machine and this machine has 3 states. Program has 4 commands that can do
and will do different things according to state that program has on that time.

Second design pattern used is Visitor pattern. That simple program shows prices before and after taxation for 4
different items.
